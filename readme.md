# SecondMain Frontend Task

You need to create a website. The website must contain 3 pages -Â 

* Signup
* Login
* Dashboard

Tasks to accomplish:

1. Develop a login and signup page allowing users to input their credentials. Implement a "forgot password" feature enabling users to reset their passwords via email.
2. Provide options for users to log in using either a Gmail or Reddit account.
3. Upon successful login, direct users to the dashboard where they will encounter a landing page, precisely resembling the provided attachments. Display fixed data fetched from a JSON response.
4. Integrate a date calendar to facilitate data filtering via calendar input, although the data remains static.
5. Create bar graphs for Page 2 and 3 based on static data, along with an emoji graph on Page 1.
6. Generate the cloud image on Page 3 dynamically based on the frequency of each word, instead of directly attaching an image. The words used may vary as illustrated in the image.
7. Represent the gauge charts on Page 4 using dynamic data rather than as static images. Each gauge chart should correspond to a different number, thus adjusting the marker accordingly.
8. Incorporate a carousel for competitors' images.
9. Optimize user experience and design; suggestions for improvements are welcome as long as all required elements are included.
10. Implement responsive design to ensure the page's compatibility with various screen sizes, including tablets, desktops, and mobile phones.
11. Include routing functionality for seamless navigation between pages.
